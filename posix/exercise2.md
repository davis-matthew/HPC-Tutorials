## 1. Mutexes

1. Review, compile and run the [dotprod_serial.c](/posix/samples/dotprod_serial.c) program. As its
        name implies, it is serial - no threads are created.
2. Now review, compile and run the [dotprod_mutex.c](../samples/dotprod_mutex.c) program. This
        version of the dotprod program uses threads and requires a mutex
        to protect the global sum as each thread updates it with their
        partial sums.
3. Execute the dotprod\_mutex program several times and notice that
        the order in which threads update the global sum varies.
4. Review, compile and run the [bug6.c](/posix/samples/bug6.c) program.
5. Run it several times and notice what the global sum is each
        time? See if you can figure out why and fix it. The explanation
        is provided in the bug examples table above, and an example
        solution is provided by the bug6fix.c program.
6. The [arrayloops.c](/posix/samples/arrayloops.c) program is another example of using a mutex to
        protect updates to a global sum. Feel free to review, compile
        and run this example code as well.

## 2.  Condition Variables

1. Review, compile and run the [condvar.c](/posix/samples/condvar.c) program. This example is
        essentially the same as the shown in the tutorial. Observe the
        output of the three threads.
2. Now, review, compile and run the [bug1.c](/posix/samples/bug1.c) program. Observe the
        output of the five threads. What happens? See if you can
        determine why and fix the problem. The explanation is provided
        in the bug examples table above, and an example solution is
        provided by the bug1fix.c program.
3. The [bug4.c](/posix/samples/bug4.c) program is yet another example of what can go wrong
        when using condition variables. Review, compile (for gcc include
        the -lm flag) and run the code. Observe the output and then see
        if you can fix the problem. The explanation is provided in the
        bug examples table above, and an example solution is provided by
        the bug4fix.c program.

## 3.  Hybrid MPI with Pthreads
1. Your pthreads directory should contain the following 5 codes:

- [mpithreads_serial.c](/posix/samples/mpithreads_serial.c)
- [mpithreads_threads.c](/posix/samples/mpithreads_threads.c)
- [mpithreads_mpi.c](/posix/samples/mpithreads_mpi.c)
- [mpithreads_both.c](/posix/samples/mpithreads_both.c)
- [mpithreads.makefile](/posix/samples/mpithreads.makefile)

These codes implement a dot product calculation and are designed
        to show the progression of developing a hybrid MPI / Pthreads
        program from a serial code. The problem size increases as the
        examples go from serial, to threads/mpi to mpi with threads.

Suggestion: simply making and running this series of codes is
        rather unremarkable. Using the available lab time to understand
        what is actually happening is the intent. The instructor is
        available for your questions.

2. Review each of the codes. The order of the listing above shows
        the "progression".
3.  Use the provided makefile to compile all of the codes at once.
        The makefile uses the gcc compiler - feel free to modify it and
        use a different compiler.

        make -f mpithreads.makefile

4.  Run each of the codes and observe their output:
<center>
<table><tbody><tr><th>Execution command</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>
            <pre><b>mpithreads_serial</b></pre>
        </td><td>Serial version - no threads or MPI</td></tr><tr><td>
            <pre><b>mpithreads_threads</b></pre>
        </td><td>Threads only version of the code using 8 threads</td></tr><tr><td>
            <pre><b>srun -n8 -ppReserved mpithreads_mpi</b></pre>
        </td><td>MPI only version with 8 tasks running on a single node in the special workshop pool</td></tr><tr><td>
            <pre><b>srun -N4 -ppReserved mpithreads_both</b></pre>
        </td><td>MPI with threads using 4 tasks running on 4 different nodes, <br/>each of which spawns 8 threads, running in special workshop pool</td></tr></tbody></table>
        </center>
