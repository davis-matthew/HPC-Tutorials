## Routines:

[`pthread_mutex_init(mutex, attr)`](man/pthread_mutex_init.txt)

[`pthread_mutex_destroy(mutex)`](man/pthread_mutex_destroy.txt)

[`pthread_mutexattr_init(attr)`](man/pthread_mutexattr_init.txt)

[`pthread_mutexattr_destroy(attr)`](man/pthread_mutexattr_destroy.txt)

## Usage:

Mutex variables must be declared with type `pthread_mutex_t`, and must be initialized before they can be used. There are two ways to initialize a mutex variable:

1. Statically, when it is declared. For example:

    `pthread_mutex_t mymutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;`

2. Dynamically, using `pthread_mutex_init()`. For example:

    ```C
    pthread_mutex_t mymutex;
    pthread_mutex_init(&mymutex, NULL);
    ```

The mutex is initially unlocked.

The `attr` object is used to establish properties for the mutex object, and must be of `type pthread_mutexattr_t` if used (may be specified as NULL to accept defaults). The Pthreads standard defines three optional mutex attributes:

* Protocol: Specifies the protocol used to prevent priority inversions for a mutex.
* Prioceiling: Specifies the priority ceiling of a mutex.
* Process-shared: Specifies the process sharing of a mutex.

Note that not all implementations may provide the three optional mutex attributes.

The `pthread_mutexattr_init()` and `pthread_mutexattr_destroy()` routines are used to create and destroy mutex attribute objects respectively.

`pthread_mutex_destroy()` should be used to free a mutex object which is no longer needed.
